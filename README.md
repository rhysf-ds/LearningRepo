# LearningRepo
I am currently learning Python coding, in this folder is my progress so far over the last month.
As a general approach i have followed along with this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/ and when it 
comes to an actual project i have stopped the course and gone and started coding once i understand the gist of the project then returned
afterwards to compare my code to the code provided on the course.
